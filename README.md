# Hide!!!
Hide!!! is a Chrome extension that allows you to hide your tabs in a pinch ;). Hide!!! allows you to use custom shortcuts both (a) to close all tabs, redirect to a new webpage, and clear your recent history and (b) to restore them as they were when you closed them. The default shortcuts are `Alt + P` to hide and `Alt + O` to restore.
