# Hide!!!
Hide!!! is a Chrome extension that allows you to hide your tabs in a pinch ;). Hide!!! allows you to use custom shortcuts to (a) close all tabs, redirect to a new (configurable) webpage, and clear your recent history and to (b) restore them as they were when you closed them. The default shortcuts are `Alt + P` to hide and `Alt + O` to restore.

## Installation
You can download it [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide/dppkgbgooinkbjemcpddmldmppgfngik?hl=en)

## Usage
1. Hold down a key when typing and wait for the pop-up to appear. Try it with uppercase letters, punctuation marks, and other symbols too.
2. To select the character you desire, you can either press the number or click on the button itself. 
3. There is also a shortcut you can use: while holding the key, press the number of the button before the popup appears.
